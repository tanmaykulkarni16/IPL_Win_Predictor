As a passionate cricket fan and ML enthusiast, I combined my two interests to develop a cutting-edge model that estimates a team's chances of winning during IPL matches. ðŸ“ˆ

ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights:

 Utilized machine learning algorithms to analyze match data.

 Engineered an array of features including team performance, player statistics,  and more.

 Integrated real-time data to make dynamic win probability predictions as the match unfolds.

 Employed ensemble techniques for robust predictions.

 Achieved close to 99% accuracy in model validation.


ðŸŒŸ Why it Matters:

Predicting live win probabilities can enhance the viewer experience and provide valuable insights for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and sportsbooks. 
It's a fascinating intersection of sports and data science and machine learning that has the potential to revolutionize how we experience cricket!
